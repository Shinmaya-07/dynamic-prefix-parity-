# dynamic-prefix-parity-
Dynamic Prefix Parity (DPP) maintains an array of bits supporting initialize, flip, and prefix-parity operations. The project explores augmented binary and multi-way trees for efficient updates and queries, and applies the Method of Four Russians to optimize parity computation using preprocessing and fast lookup techniques.
